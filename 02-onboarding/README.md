# Software Team On-boarding

## 1. Meet the team :busts_in_silhouette:
* A full list of the `Sunbird team` members is available on the Sunbird website [`about page`](https://sunbird.ai/about/#SBteam).

## 2. Meetings :calendar:
* Meetings are generally held every Monday, Wendesday and Friday, as detailed below: 
    * The Monday meeting is a `Technical sync`, a meeting for the tech team to discuss tech-related issues (e.g blockers).
    * The Wednesday meeting is a `Reading group meeting` for the tech team and it is meant for research-related discussions (reading papers, writing research proposals etc).
    * The Friday meeting is a `Sunbird sync`, a company-wide meeting including non-tech departments like Operations and Finance. It is used to present progress on ongoing work.
* Specific `Software Team` meetings are held once a week (details are added to each team member's Google calendar).

## 3. Projects and OKRs :chart_with_upwards_trend:

**OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):**<br/>
Sunbird uses OKRs to plan, manage and track projects. Our OKRs are discussed and documented at the beginning of each quarter.

## 4. Task tracking :outbox_tray:
Tasks are created from the OKRs mentioned above and the software-related ones are tracked using [`GitHub projects`](https://github.com/orgs/SunbirdAI/projects).

## 5. Tech stack & tools :computer:
Sunbird coding projects include Machine Learning (ML) models, backend, frontend and DevOps/MLOps. The main programming languages used are `Python` for ML and backend and `Javascript` for frontend. <br/>
For a more detailed breakdown of the languages and tech stack (including libraries, frameworks and tools/platforms), please refer to the [`Development Process`](https://github.com/SunbirdAI/sunbird-docs/tree/main/04-development-process) section.
 
## 6. Deployment processes :wrench:

## 7. Other onboarding activities :mailbox:
* 1-on-1s for new engineers with the rest of the team to build rapport and share company culture
* Setting goals and expectations for each team member's role and what success looks like in the role
* Buddy system, in which each new engineer is assigned a buddy/buddies to help them onboard onto the team
