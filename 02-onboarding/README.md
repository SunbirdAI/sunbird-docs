## 2. Meetings :calendar:

    * The Monday meeting is a `Technical sync`, a meeting for the tech team to discuss tech-related issues (e.g blockers).

    * The Friday meeting is a `Sunbird sync`, a company-wide meeting including non-tech departments like Operations and Finance. It is used to present progress on ongoing work.
* Specific `Software Team` meetings are held once a week (details are added to each team member's Google calendar).
