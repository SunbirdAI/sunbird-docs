# Development Process

## System design document
Ideally, each major project (maybe even feature) should have a system design document. This helps us plan for the project and understand what kind of work needs to be done. 

This document should contain:
- Introduction of what the project is about.
- Requirements (functional and non-functional).
- Propose solution / Architecture
- Alternative solutions
- Testability / Alerting / Monitoring
- Detailed scoping and timelines
